#Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Implementations

This repository contains Python implementations of various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using PyTorch framework. The implemented models include Vanilla GAN, DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN), and SRGAN (Super-Resolution GAN). Each model is implemented with detailed comments for easy understanding and modification.

Implemented Models

1. Vanilla GAN
The Vanilla GAN is one of the simplest forms of GANs, consisting of a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns to produce data similar to the training set, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real and generated data.

2. DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
DCGAN is an extension of the Vanilla GAN architecture, incorporating deep convolutional networks for both the generator and the discriminator. This model typically produces higher quality images compared to Vanilla GAN due to its deeper architecture and use of convolutional layers.

3. SRGAN (Super-Resolution GAN)
SRGAN is a GAN architecture specifically designed for single-image super-resolution tasks. It learns to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results in image upscaling.
